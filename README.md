<h1><b>Dagu</b></h1>

A powerful, self-contained Cron alternative with a clean Web UI and a [declarative YAML-based workflow definition](https://dagu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yaml_format.html). Dagu simplifies complex job dependencies and scheduling with minimal overhead.

---

## **Highlights**

- **Simple Installation**: Single binary, no dependencies
- **Intuitive Web UI**: Visualize, monitor, and control workflows
- **YAML-based**: Define workflows in simple YAML files
- **Built-in Executors**: Support for Docker, HTTP, SSH, and more
- **Zero Config**: No database required, works out of the box

## **Features**

- Web UI & CLI
- Web API Interface
- Powerful DAG definition in YAML format:
  - Code snippets, parameters, environment variables
  - Command substitution, piping, conditional logic
  - Redirection of stdout and stderr
  - Lifecycle hooks (on failure, on exit, etc.)
  - Repeating tasks, automatic/manual retry
  - Run sub workflows
- Handy built-in executors:
  - Docker containers
  - HTTP requests
  - Email sending
  - JSON query with jq
  - SSH remote commands
- Remote Dagu node management
- Email notification
- Scheduling with Cron expressions


## **Why we built Dagu**

In many organizations, legacy systems still rely on hundreds of cron jobs running across multiple servers. These jobs are often written in various languages like Perl or Shell scripts, with implicit interdependencies. When one job fails, troubleshooting requires manually logging into servers via SSH and checking individual logs. To perform recovery, one must understand these implicit dependencies, which often rely on tribal knowledge. Dagu was developed to eliminate this complexity by providing a clear and understandable tool for workflow definition and dependency management.

## **A Lightweight and Self-Contained Solution**

While Cron is lightweight and suitable for simple scheduling, it doesn't scale well for complex workflows or provide features like retries, dependencies, or observability out of the box. On the other hand, tools like Airflow or other workflow engines can be overly complex for smaller projects or legacy environments, with steep learning curves and burdensome to maintain. Dagu strikes a balance: it's easy to use, self-contained, and require no coding, making it ideal for smaller projects.

## **Built By and For In-House Developers**

Dagu's design philosophy stems from the real-world experience in managing complex jobs across diverse environments, from small startups to enterprise companies. By focusing on simplicity, transparency, and minimal setup overhead, Dagu aims to make life easier for in-house developers who need a robust workflow engine without the heavy lift of a more complex tool.

## **Installation**

Dagu can be installed in multiple ways, such as using Homebrew or downloading a single binary from GitHub releases.

### Via Bash script

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagu-org/dagu/main/scripts/installer.sh | bash
```

### Via GitHub Releases Page

Download the latest binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/dagu-org/dagu/releases) and place it in your `$PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).

### Via Homebrew (macOS)

```sh
brew install dagu-org/brew/dagu
```

Upgrade to the latest version:

```sh
brew upgrade dagu-org/brew/dagu
```

### Via Docker

```sh
docker run \
--rm \
-p 8080:8080 \
-v ~/.config/dagu:/config \
-e DAGU_TZ=`ls -l /etc/localtime | awk -F'/zoneinfo/' '{print $2}'` \
ghcr.io/dagu-org/dagu:latest dagu start-all
```

Note: The environment variable `DAGU_TZ` is the timezone for the scheduler and server. You can set it to your local timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`).

See [Environment variables](https://dagu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#environment-variables) to configure those default directories.

## **Quick Start Guide**

### 1. Launch the Web UI

Start the server and scheduler with the command `dagu start-all` and browse to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to explore the Web UI.

### 2. Create a New DAG

Navigate to the DAG List page by clicking the menu in the left panel of the Web UI. Then create a DAG by clicking the `NEW` button at the top of the page. Enter `example` in the dialog.

_Note: DAG (YAML) files will be placed in `~/.config/dagu/dags` by default. See [Configuration Options](https://dagu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) for more details._

### 3. Edit the DAG

Go to the `SPEC` Tab and hit the `Edit` button. Copy & Paste the following example and click the `Save` button.

Example:

```yaml
schedule: "* * * * *" # Run the DAG every minute
params:
  - NAME: "Dagu"
steps:
  - name: Hello world
    command: echo Hello $NAME
  - name: Done
    command: echo Done!
    depends: Hello world
```

### 4. Execute the DAG

You can execute the example by pressing the `Start` button. You can see "Hello Dagu" in the log page in the Web UI.

## **CLI**

```sh
# Runs the DAG
dagu start <file>

# Runs the DAG with named parameters
dagu start <file> [-- <key>=<value> ...]

# Runs the DAG with positional parameters
dagu start <file> [-- value1 value2 ...]

# Displays the current status of the DAG
dagu status <file>

# Re-runs the specified DAG run
dagu retry --req=<request-id> <file>

# Stops the DAG execution
dagu stop <file>

# Restarts the current running DAG
dagu restart <file>

# Dry-runs the DAG
dagu dry <file> [-- <key>=<value> ...]

# Launches both the web UI server and scheduler process
dagu start-all [--host=<host>] [--port=<port>] [--dags=<path to directory>]

# Launches the Dagu web UI server
dagu server [--host=<host>] [--port=<port>] [--dags=<path to directory>]

# Starts the scheduler process
dagu scheduler [--dags=<path to directory>]

# Shows the current binary version
dagu version
```

## **Remote Node Management**

Dagu supports managing multiple Dagu servers from a single UI through its remote node feature. This allows you to:

- Monitor and manage DAGs across different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Access multiple Dagu instances from a centralized UI
- Switch between nodes easily through the UI dropdown

See [Remote Node Configuration](https://dagu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_remote.html) for more details.

### Configuration

Create `config.yaml` in `$HOME/.config/dagu/`:

```yaml
remoteNodes:
  - name: "prod"
    apiBaseUrl: "https://prod.example.com/api/v1"
  - name: "staging"
    apiBaseUrl: "https://staging.example.com/api/v1"
```

## **Example DAG**

### Minimal examples

A DAG with two steps:

```yaml
params:
  - NAME: "Dagu"
steps:
  - name: Hello world
    command: echo Hello $NAME
  - name: Done
    command: echo Done!
    depends:
      - Hello world
```

Using a pipe:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: step 1
    command: echo hello world | xargs echo
```

Specifying a shell:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: step 1
    command: echo hello world | xargs echo
    shell: bash # The default shell is `$SHELL` or `sh`.
```

You can also define each steps as map instead of list:

```yaml
steps:
  step1:
    command: echo "Hello"
  step2:
    command: echo "Bye"
    depends: step1
```

### Conditional DAG

You can add conditional logic to a DAG:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: monthly task
    command: monthly.sh
    preconditions:
      - condition: "`date '+%d'`"
        expected: "re:0[1-9]" # Run only if the day is between 01 and 09
```

### Scheduling

You can specify the schedule with cron expression:

```yaml
schedule: "5 4 * * *" # Run at 04:05.
steps:
  - name: scheduled job
    command: job.sh
```

Or you can set multiple schedules.

```yaml
schedule:
  - "30 7 * * *" # Run at 7:30
  - "0 20 * * *" # Also run at 20:00
steps:
  - name: scheduled job
    command: job.sh
```

If you want to start and stop a long-running process on a fixed schedule, you can define ``start`` and ``stop`` times:

```yaml
schedule:
  start: "0 8 * * *" # starts at 8:00
  stop: "0 13 * * *" # stops at 13:00
steps:
  - name: scheduled job
    command: job.sh
```

### Calling a sub-DAG

You can call a sub-DAG from a parent DAG:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: parent
    run: sub-dag
    output: OUT
  - name: use output
    command: echo ${OUT.outputs.result}
    depends: parent
```

The sub-DAG `sub-dag.yaml`:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: sub-dag
    command: echo "Hello from sub-dag"
    output: result
```

THe parent DAG will call the sub-DAG and write the output to the log (stdout).
The output will be `Hello from sub-dag`.

#### Running a docker image

You can run a docker image as a step:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: hello
    executor:
      type: docker
      config:
        image: alpine
        autoRemove: true
    command: echo "hello"
```

### A bigger example

A typical data pipeline for DevOps/Data Engineering scenarios:

![Details-TD](assets/images/example.webp?raw=true)

The YAML code below represents this DAG:

```yaml
# Environment variables used throughout the pipeline
env:
  - DATA_DIR: /data
  - SCRIPT_DIR: /scripts
  - LOG_DIR: /log
  # ... other variables can be added here

# Handlers to manage errors and cleanup after execution
handlerOn:
  failure:
    command: "echo error"
  exit:
    command: "echo clean up"

# The schedule for the DAG execution in cron format
# This schedule runs the DAG daily at 12:00 AM
schedule: "0 0 * * *"

steps:
  # Step 1: Pull the latest data from a data source
  - name: pull_data
    command: "sh"
    script: echo `date '+%Y-%m-%d'`
    output: DATE

  # Step 2: Cleanse and prepare the data
  - name: cleanse_data
    command: echo cleansing ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}.csv
    depends:
      - pull_data

  # Step 3: Transform the data
  - name: transform_data
    command: echo transforming ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}_clean.csv
    depends:
      - cleanse_data

  # Parallel Step 1: Load the data into a database
  - name: load_data
    command: echo loading ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}_transformed.csv
    depends:
      - transform_data

  # Parallel Step 2: Generate a statistical report
  - name: generate_report
    command: echo generating report ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}_transformed.csv
    depends:
      - transform_data

  # Step 4: Run some analytics
  - name: run_analytics
    command: echo running analytics ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}_transformed.csv
    depends:
      - load_data

  # Step 5: Send an email report
  - name: send_report
    command: echo sending email ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}_analytics.csv
    depends:
      - run_analytics
      - generate_report

  # Step 6: Cleanup temporary files
  - name: cleanup
    command: echo removing ${DATE}*.csv
    depends:
      - send_report
```

More examples can be found in the [documentation](https://dagu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yaml_format.html).

## **Running as a daemon**

The easiest way to make sure the process is always running on your system is to create the script below and execute it every minute using cron (you don't need `root` account in this way):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
process="dagu start-all"
command="/usr/bin/dagu start-all"

if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep "$process" > /dev/null
then
    exit
else
    $command &
fi

exit
```

## **How It Works**

Dagu is a single command line tool that uses the local file system to store data, so no database management system or cloud service is required. DAGs are defined in a declarative YAML format, and existing programs can be used without modification.
